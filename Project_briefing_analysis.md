PROJECT BRIEFING ANALYSIS
===============
Now that you know the expectations regarding the tone of voice and general style considerations, it is time to make the next step. Every project handout contains the so called **project briefing**. 
The most vital thing to remember is the difference between the following workflows:

* Translation only
* Translation + editing
* Translation + editing + proofreading

**Translation only**

This is the most basic workflow our client orders for non-customer facing outputs, such as e.g. internal guidelines of lesser importance. Since it is ONLY YOU who is expected to work on the project,
make sure to check all the segments (called matches) as well as repetitions and context matches. The final (but equally important) step is to perform a quality assurance task being explained later. Afterwards, you instead of the project manager are expected to 
forward the delivery to our final client. For more information about the various segment types, please go to the chapter [File types - what can you expect](File_types_what_can_you_expect.md).

**Translation + editing**

This process consists of two basic steps:

Translation: This is the initial phase where the content is translated from the source language into the target language, as per usual requirements you can see in the chapter "FILES TYPES - WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT".

Editing: Once the translation is complete, the text undergoes an editing process. You will be informed about your editor and the way of submitting your work to them.

**Translation + editing + proofreading**

The translation + editing + proofreading step combines three essential stages:

Translation: This is the initial phase where the content is translated from the source language into the target language, as per usual requirements you can see in the chapter "FILES TYPES - WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT". 

Editing: Once the translation is complete, the text undergoes an editing process. You will be informed about your editor and the way of submitting your work to them.

Proofreading: After editing, the proofreading stage focuses on meticulously checking the translated text for any remaining errors or typos. A proofreader carefully examines the text to ensure it is free of spelling mistakes, punctuation errors, formatting issues, and other minor inaccuracies.
It is also **their** duty to submit the completed project to the final client.

Irrespective of the project workflow, please always maintain the highest quality standard and do not forget to run xBench on the translated files. Some detailed instructions on how to do this will be provided in the subsequent
sections of this manual.

 > Always bear in mind that any details on your side may severely impede the whole project, so make sure to inform your project manager of these **in due time**!
