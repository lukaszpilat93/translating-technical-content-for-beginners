FILE TYPES - WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT AND HOW TO PROCEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL
===============

In the course of your recruitment process, you were given a brief introduction to the company's main fields of expertise. 
Since your scope of responsibilities will include translating automotive manuals from German to Polish,
you must know the core differences between the two types you are likely to encounter after the onboarding process:

| Document type | Way of addressing the reader             | Tone of voice | Abbreviations                                    |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------- |
| Nars          | Informal, simple and friendly (2nd person singular) | Informal      | Field-specific abbreviations allowed, first instance explained |
| ARKI          | Formal, official (3rd person plural)   | Formal        | Abbreviations allowed, first instance explained, only use widely known abbreviations |


**SPECIFIC HINTS FOR NARS FILES**

<div style="border: 1px solid red; padding: 10px; background-color: #f8d7da; color: #721c24;">
  <strong>⚠️ Warning:</strong>
</div>
Please also note that in the Nars files, you will find some specific codes that indicate a special workflow.

Whenever you see an *AP00 file*, please do not follow the normal structure for orders, such as e.g. Dokręć śrubę, but use the infinitive form, instead (in this case "Dokręcenie śruby"). This is especially important as these files are
integral parts of the so-called service sheets, i.e. lists of actions, rather than simple instructions. To proceed properly, always consult the source files you can find in the project reference material folder. 

**SPECIFIC HINTS FOR ARKI FILES**

ARKI files may contain some content specific to the target market. Whenever you encounter some of these, please always refer to the reference material provided or, in case this does not solve the issue, consult your
Mercedes-Benz AG or Daimler Truck AG contact person. Ensure that you do it BEFORE the project submission deadline to avoid any potential issues about file correction or, even worse, escalation. These files
have a very tight time-to-market schedule!

**GENERAL STYLE & GRAMMAR CONSIDERATIONS**

Irrespective of the file type, please bear in mind that you are expected to provide meticulous, error-free translation as it is a vital part of the brand's image. Should any doubts arise, never guess the correct workflow. Instead, please
DO CONSULT the widely known reference. To find out more, please visit [Further reading + references](Further_reading_and_references.md).
